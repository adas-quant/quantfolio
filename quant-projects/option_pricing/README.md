# ðŸ“ˆ Option Pricing Models

This module demonstrates option pricing using various theoretical models â€” both for learning and prototyping quant infrastructure.

### ðŸ“Œ Included Notebooks:
- `quantlib_black_scholes.ipynb`: Price European call/put options using QuantLibâ€™s Black-Scholes engine.
- `monte_carlo_pricing.ipynb`: Estimate option price via Monte Carlo simulation of terminal prices.
- `binomial_tree_pricing.ipynb`: Price options using CRR/Jarrow-Rudd binomial tree models.

### ðŸ§  Concepts Covered:
- Black-Scholes Merton framework
- Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega) estimation
- Risk-neutral valuation
- Path-based vs closed-form pricing

> ðŸ“š Goal: Build foundational understanding of pricing, while getting hands-on with QuantLib, NumPy, and visualization tools.
